This folder contain environment information the application/dev needs.
Currently its only use is to store your blockfrost API keys. To set up your API keys
simply copy the template named _blockfrost.template.ts_ to a new file named \_blockforst.secrets.ts_and fill in the comments with
the keys you've received from [blockfrost](https://blockfrost.io/).
